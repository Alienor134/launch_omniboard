# Check Python version
python --version  # Should be 3.8+

# Check Docker is running
docker --version
docker ps

# Check MongoDB is accessible
mongosh --version  # or mongo --version
```

### From Source

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/DreamRepo/Altar.git
   cd Altar/AltarViewer
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment** (recommended)
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   
   # On Windows
   venv\Scripts\activate
   
   # On macOS/Linux
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Run the application**
   ```bash
   python src/main.py
   ```

### From Binary Release

Download the latest executable from the [releases page](https://github.com/Alienor134/launch_omniboard/releases) and run directly. No Python installation required.

## Usage

### Quick Start

1. **Launch the application**
   ```bash
   python src/main.py
   ```

2. **Connect to MongoDB**
    - Choose a connection mode:
       - Port: enter your MongoDB port (default: `27017` for localhost)
       - Full URI: paste a full MongoDB connection URI (works with Atlas, remote VMs, authentication, TLS and options)
          - Security note: do not paste passwords here. Prefer the "Credential URI" tab to avoid storing secrets in plain text.
          - Example: `mongodb+srv://user:pass@my-cluster.mongodb.net/?retryWrites=true&w=majority`
       - Credential URI: paste a credential-less URI (e.g., `mongodb://host:27017/yourdb`) and enter username/password separately
          - Optionally save your password securely using the OS keyring
    - Click "Connect" to list available databases

3. **Select a database**
   - Choose a database from the dropdown list
   - Click "Launch Omniboard"

4. **Access Omniboard**
   - A clickable link will appear in the interface
   - Omniboard opens automatically in your default browser

### Configuration

#### MongoDB Connection
- **Connection Modes**:
   - Port: quick local development; launches Omniboard with `-m host:port:database`
     - On Windows/macOS (Docker Desktop), if you connect to `localhost`/`127.0.0.1`, the app maps it to `host.docker.internal` so the container can reach your host MongoDB.
   - Full URI: recommended for Atlas/remote; launches Omniboard with `--mu <uri-with-db>`
      - The selected database is injected into the URI path before launching Omniboard, while preserving credentials and query parameters.
      - Example constructed argument:
         - `--mu "mongodb+srv://user:pass@MONGO_IP/DB_NAME?authsource=DB_NAME"`
      - For security, the app does not persist Full URI values between sessions.
   - Credential URI: enter a credential-less URI and provide username/password separately
      - Passwords are stored only in the OS keyring if you opt in; they are never written to disk
- **Default Port**: 27017
- **Authentication**: Supply credentials in your URI for Full URI mode

#### Port Management
- **Deterministic Port Assignment**: Ports are generated using a hash of the database name (base: 20000, range: 10000)
- **Browser Cookie Preservation**: The same database always gets the same port, preserving Omniboard customizations and cookies in your browser
- **Automatic Conflict Resolution**: If the preferred port is unavailable, the next free port is automatically selected
- **Port Range**: 20000-29999 (based on SHA-256 hash of database name)

## Development

### Setting Up Development Environment

1. **Clone and setup**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/DreamRepo/Altar.git
   cd Altar/AltarViewer
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # or venv\Scripts\activate on Windows
   ```

2. **Install development dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
   ```

### Key Components

- **GUI Layer** ([gui.py](src/gui.py)): CustomTkinter-based interface
- **MongoDB Layer** ([mongodb.py](src/mongodb.py)): Database connection and queries
- **Omniboard Layer** ([omniboard.py](src/omniboard.py)): Docker container management with hash-based port assignment
- **Main Controller** ([main.py](src/main.py)): Application orchestration

### Port Assignment Algorithm

The application uses a deterministic hash-based port assignment:
```python
port = 20000 + (SHA256(database_name) % 10000)
```
This ensures:
- **Consistency**: Same database → same port
- **Browser Persistence**: Cookies and customizations are preserved
- **Conflict Handling**: Automatic fallback to next available port if needed

## Troubleshooting

### Connection Errors

**Problem**: "Connection Error" when connecting to MongoDB

**Solutions**:
- Ensure MongoDB is running: `mongosh` or `mongo`
- Check the port number (default: 27017)
- Verify firewall settings allow connections
- Check MongoDB logs for authentication issues

### Docker Issues

**Problem**: Docker-related errors when launching Omniboard

**Solutions**:
- Verify Docker Desktop is running: `docker ps`
- Check Docker has sufficient resources allocated
- Ensure port 9005+ are not in use by other applications
- Try clearing old containers: Use the cleanup button in the app
 - If using the packaged EXE, ensure the Docker CLI is on PATH or installed in the default location. The app resolves common Docker paths but may fail if the CLI is missing.
 - On slower machines, Docker initialization can take >30s after launch; the app now waits up to 60s, but if you still see “Docker not running”, retry once Docker is fully ready.
 - The app does not auto-start Docker on any OS. Please start Docker Desktop (or the Docker service) manually, wait for it to be ready, and then launch Omniboard.

Note: The app does not rewrite hosts (e.g., no host.docker.internal mapping). It uses the host you provide as-is.

### Omniboard stuck on "Loading app..."

**Common causes**:
- The connection string used inside the container is missing the selected database
- `localhost` from the host OS is unreachable from inside Docker (Windows/macOS)
- Authentication failure or insufficient permissions on the selected database

**What the app does**:
- In Full URI mode, it injects the selected database into the URI and uses `--mu`, preserving credentials/options

**What to check**:
- Validate your URI with `mongosh` and ensure it has read access to the selected DB
- Confirm the container is running, or use the cleanup button and relaunch
- Give the container a few seconds after launch to initialize

### Database list shows only one entry

Some deployments (e.g., MongoDB Atlas or non-admin users) do not allow the `listDatabases` command. In that case, the app falls back to the database present in your connection URI so you can still launch Omniboard for it.

### Port Conflicts

**Problem**: "Port already in use" errors

**Solutions**:
- The application automatically finds the next available port if the preferred port is busy
- Use the "Clear Omniboard Docker Containers" button to remove old containers
- Manually check and stop containers:
  ```bash
  docker ps
  docker stop <container_id>
  ```
- Check for other applications using ports 20000-29999

**Note**: Each database consistently uses the same port (hash-based), allowing your browser to remember Omniboard customizations and preferences per database

### Import Errors

**Problem**: Missing module errors when running from source

**Solutions**:
- Reinstall dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Ensure virtual environment is activated
- Check Python version compatibility (3.8+)

### Keyring not available or password not remembered

If the "Save password securely" option is disabled or your password does not reappear:
- Ensure the `keyring` package is installed in your environment: `pip install keyring`
- On Linux, ensure you have a supported keyring backend (e.g., gnome-keyring/Secret Service or KWallet) and a running session
- The app never writes passwords to disk; they are stored only in the OS keychain when this option is enabled

### Preferences file shows up when building/running from repo

Older versions saved preferences at `~/.altarviewer_config.json`, which could be affected if the `HOME` environment variable was overridden (e.g., by certain shells/tools) while running inside a repository folder. The app now stores preferences in the standard OS config location (e.g., `%APPDATA%\AltarViewer\config.json` on Windows) using `platformdirs`, so it no longer depends on the current working directory or `HOME`. Existing legacy configs are read for compatibility but new saves go to the stable location.
