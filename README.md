## Overview

This application provides a graphical interface to:
- Connect to a local MongoDB instance.
- List available databases.
- Select a database and launch [Omniboard](https://vivekratnavel.github.io/omniboard/) in a Docker container for experiment tracking and visualization.
- Clean up Omniboard Docker containers.

## Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- Docker Desktop (must be running)
- Local MongoDB instance running
- No need to install `pymongo` or `tkinter` separately if using the provided executable.

## Usage

### As a Python Script

1. Install dependencies:
    ```
    pip install pymongo
    pip install customtkinter
    ```

    or refer to the requirements.txt

2. Run the script:
    ```
    python omniboard_launch.py
    ```


### App Features

- **Port selection:** Enter the port of your local MongoDB (default: 27017).
- **Connect:** Lists all available databases.
- **Database selection:** Select a database to enable the "Launch Omniboard" button.
- **Launch Omniboard:** Starts Omniboard in Docker and prints a clickable link to access it in your browser.
- **Clear Omniboard Docker Containers:** Removes all Omniboard containers started by this app.

## Notes

- Each Omniboard instance runs on a free port (starting from 9005).
- Docker must be installed and running.
- The app only supports local MongoDB connections.
- The clickable link for Omniboard appears in the app interface after launching.

## Troubleshooting

- If you see "Connection Error", ensure MongoDB is running and accessible on the specified port.
- If Docker reports port conflicts, use the "Clear Omniboard Docker Containers" button.
- For any issues with the executable, ensure all dependencies are bundled or use the Python script directly.
